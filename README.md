# Parallel algorithms implementation

## Algorithms implemented
- k-means
- sample sort
- barnes-hut n-body simulation

## Languages/frameworks used
- C + OpenMP/MPI
- Chapel
- Julia

# Roadmap

## k-means

### C

- [ ] Sequential implementation
- [ ] Shared memory implementation
- [ ] Distributed memory implementation

### Julia

- [ ] Sequential implementation
- [ ] Shared memory implementation
- [ ] Distributed memory implementation

### Chapel

- [ ] Sequential implementation
- [ ] Shared memory implementation
- [ ] Distributed memory implementation

### Evaluation

Evaluate all implementations:
- different number of points
- different number of clusters
- different number of threads/processes

### TODO

- [ ] Implement k-means++
